      <p>
        Oh no! We have sales reps on the floor and they're going crazy. Some are
        running around wreaking havoc and not doing their jobs! Quick,
        HomeAdvisor needs a new leader, NOW!
      </p>
      <p>
        You will play as Jim, a sales rep who doesn't participate in his peers
        bad habits. Jim believes in their potential and wants to see each
        individual thrive. Even though Jim has good intentions, he must lead
        himself first before leading others at HomeAdvisor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Catch the LDP Modules, assignments and initiatives to build Jim's resume
        and brand to become the next great leader that HomeAdvisor needs. Watch
        out for distractions though that might hurt you along the way. Remember
        3 strikes and you're out!
